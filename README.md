1. BOSTON REGRESSION: Prediction of House Prices. Features: Average number of rooms, Per capita crime  rate by town, Accessibility to radial highways, % lower  status of the population etc. Techniques Used: Linear Regression, OLS.


2. MTCARS REGRESSION: Linear Regression - Mileage Prediction:  Objective: Predict the "Mileage" of Cars based on different Predictors using Linear Regression ML Algorithm


3. FEDERALIST PAPERS:In the early days of The United States of America around the time when the Constitution was being signed did a series of articles were published in various newspapers. These papers were writing under the false name . It was later revealed to have been the collected works of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay.
Using classification method to predict the authorship of the disputed papers.


4. KNN CLASSIFIER Titanic Dataset: Analysis on Titanic training Dataset using KNN classifier and PCA and predicting the survivors using the test dataset.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
Here I've build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).


5. BREAST CANCER DATA: Classified breast cancer cells into Malignant & Benign. Features: Cell attributes include mean- radius of cells, texture of cells, area worst etc. 
Techniques Used: KNN Classifier and PCA
